# sjl87_EECS373_PS5
repo for code used for PS5: reactive task commander for EECS373

Most of this code is packages from EECS373. I used the file irb120_reactive_task_commander.cpp to create a similar file irb120_reactive_pushing_commander.cpp in the same directory (src/Part_5/irb120/irb120_task_commander/src/). The reactive pushing task commander is modified to fulfill the requirements of PS5.
